Hi,
I developed a basic Xamarin Android application, so it's running on Android only.

This app lists 2 pages from the required database to show more than the first 20.
At the first page it shows the Released movies and Top rated in two columns,
all that are clickable, that show details.

I've used RestSharp to get the url and every other things, creating conversors by myself.

This is just a fast development, 
so I apreciate for your comments.

Best wishes,
Eduardo Silveira.
