# ArcTech
Hi,
This is a basic Xamarin Android application developed to ArchTech for a role test.

It's a two column app showing the upcoing and top movies in a list,
booth have details in target click.
I've used listview, linearlayout and just a few css to get a better view.

This app lists 2 pages from the required database to show more than the first 20.
At the first page it shows the Released movies and Top rated in two columns,
all that are clickable, that show details.

I've used RestSharp to get the url and every other things that it's easyer to work with requests.

This is just a fast development, 
so I apreciate for your comments.

Best wishes,
Eduardo Silveira.
